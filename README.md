# SQL Project 2: International Online Sales
A project using a public dataset to practice writing queries to answer real examples of business questions. Unlike the other SQL project I have completed, I started with the raw dataset here and came up with the questions myself. 

_Please note that since the notebook has been downloaded from the DataCamp platform, and it contains code, the 'Code' tab of the notebook.ipynb file does not contain the code I wrote, but rather the code for the notebook._

# Documents in this repository

In this repository, besides this README document, there are two files. The original raw data (online_retail.csv) file which contains data relating the online orders that a business received over the course of a year is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, so I have uploaded a .zip of this file. I have pretended that I am the manager of this business and want to find out some information about the orders "I" have received over the year. The other file is a notebook. 

The notebook contains the code I wrote to preview the dataset, the report writing I did between queries, and the results of those queries. 

# Results 

I was able to find answers to all of the questions I asked; more information relating to this can be found in the notebook file (on the 'preview' setting), including the results of the queries and what the results suggest.
